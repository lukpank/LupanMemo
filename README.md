# Lupan Memo

Lupan Memo is a game for Android.

The aim of the game is to uncover all of the images in the minimum
number of moves. Images are uncovered pairwise (by clicking selected
images) and if they are identical then they are removed from the board
and if they are different then they are covered again.
